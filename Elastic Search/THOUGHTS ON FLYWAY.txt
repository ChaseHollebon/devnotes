	flyway is an open-source tool that solves these problems

	1. We need to change our database							  (We add SQL scripts to db-migrations/src/main/resources/db/migrations/)
	2. We need to push those changes to production				  (the sync-service by default:                        runs flyway:migrate
	3. We need to share those changes with our fellow developers  (the sync-service with a special option that will:   runs flyway:clean and then flyway:migrate
