HOW TO SET UP A PAGE EX:

Exercise 4a / Create a new page
------------------------------------------------
1. Create the component:  ClientGridPage4 (example)

ng g c ClientGridPage4



 2. Tell the router that "page/client-grid-4" takes you to the new component
 
   { path:  Constants.CLIENT_GRID_PAGE_4_ROUTE,                    component: ClientGridPage4Component            

 
 3. Add a link in the navbar that says "Client Grid Page 4"
 
 {
		navGroupName: "Client Grid Page 4",
		faIconTag: "fa-chart-pie",
		navGroupItems: [
			{
				navItemName: "Client Grid Page 4",
				navItemUrl: Constants.CLIENT_GRID_PAGE_4_ROUTE,
			}
		]
	}


 4. Add a link to the consntans.ts
 
   CLIENT_GRID_PAGE_4_ROUTE                       = "page/client-grid-page-4",
   
 
 5. Add your uicontrols to your V1.1_security.sql
 
 insert into uicontrols(id, name) values(3003, 'page/client-grid-page-4');

 (Might have to grant this page to a certain role... for now the SUPERVISOR and the ADMIN get granted access to all pages)
 
 

 6. NUKE THE DATABASE



 7. Verify that the navbar link works
    a. Activate the debugger
    b. Go to http://localhost:4200/
    c. Verify that you see the link called "Client Grid Page 4"
    d. Click on the link
       -- Verify it says, "client-grid-page-4 works!"
