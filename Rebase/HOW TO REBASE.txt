How to do a Git Rebase?
How to update branch to the latest Development?
-----------------------------------------------
1. Make sure your branch is clean (everything has been committed and pushed up)

2. Get the latest development branch    ( cd into the Parent directory & make sure your not in development branch )
    a. CMD> git branch -D development         // Delete the development branch
    b. CMD> git fetch -a                      // Get the latest development branch
    c. CMD> git checkout development

 3. Checkout the branch you want to rebase

 4. Pull Git -> Rebase

 5. ( If there is a pop-up )
    a. Uncheck "Interactive"
    b. In the "onto", choose development (or the branch with other people's changes)
    c. Click "Rebase"

 6. Resolve conflicts (if there are any)


 7. Compile your code

    b. CMD> cd.. (if in Frontend directory)
       CMD> mvn clean package -Pprod


 8. If it compiles perfectly, then do a force push
    a. CMD> git push -f                         // This does a “force push”, which will push your rebased local branch with the updated merges.
